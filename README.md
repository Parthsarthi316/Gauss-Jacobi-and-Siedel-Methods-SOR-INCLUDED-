# Gauss-Jacobi-and-Siedel-Methods-SOR-INCLUDED-MATLAB-Code

dusramain is the main for Gauss-Siedel with SOR while mainhai is for the Jacobi and Siedel 

All calculations are done in functions as one can see the name of the function is self explainatory of what the function is calculating. 

mainhai calls both functions for jacobi and siedel and shows a comparison between the two on the other hand dusramain calls the SOR function.
